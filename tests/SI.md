# Sophia Integrations

## SI-0

Sophia Integrations, abbreviated as SIs, are internal tickets used to implement the specification of the Sophia interpreter. SIs are numbered in order of creation: this one is SI-0. The ordering is permanent.

SIs are associated with a description of their requirements, an integration test, and the unit tests used for the components associated with the SI. Unit tests may be changed and reordered as is necessary.

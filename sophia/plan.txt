member types

list[int]

sequence types specify the type of their members
the closest mutual type of a list's members are determined upon its creation
the interpreter always knows the member type of a sequence; thus, type checking is never necessary
unlike union and intersection types, member types do not actually exist as distinct types
rather, the member type is queried as a property of the sequence when needed
